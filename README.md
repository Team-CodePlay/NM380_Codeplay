## Problem Statement
App for recording and playing geotagged videos.
Develop a mobile application for recording and playing geotagged videos.

Unlike photos in which geotag data is of a single point and orientation pair, for videos geotag data is a sequence of point and orientation pairs.

The mobile application should have two views. In one view the recorded video should play while simultaneously plotting field-of-view (orientation) cone and marker on an interactive map in the other view in a synchronized manner.

The position shown on the map should match the play position of the video.

The geotagged locations should be exportable in KML format with time tag information.
